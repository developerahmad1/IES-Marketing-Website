              </h2>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                A respectable team of developers with a track record of
                completing prosperous residential buildings is behind the
                development of Model Town Multan. The Evacuee Trust Property
                Board (ETPB) and the development department of Multan (MDA)
                cooperated to create the Multan Block A and B of the Model City.
                The developers have remained committed to providing the promised
                facilities on schedule, building with high quality materials,
                and urban planning. ETPB is the owner of 99 acres, which were
                approved by the government in 1999.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                The owners of each of the 490 plots have successfully received
                their plots. During these phases, all infrastructure
                developments, including roads, electricity, water supply, and
                sanitation, have been completed. Block C is a self-sustaining
                revenue-generating initiative of MDA, which was started in 2005.
                It includes 226 plots covering an area of 41 acres. This phase
                will also include the completion of landscaping works, including
                the installation of necessary communications and utilities. Both
                investors and end users have expressed a great deal of interest
                in the project because of its well-thought-out layout and
                design, which demonstrates their skill and experience.
