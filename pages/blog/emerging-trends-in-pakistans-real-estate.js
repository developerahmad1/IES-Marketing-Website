                                <p className="pb-6">Community living is becoming a popular trend in Pakistan real estate. People prefer to live in gated communities, offering a range of amenities and security features and providing a high standard of living. Such amenities mostly include family parks, community centers, shopping areas, educational institutions, and sports facilities. In addition, waste management, maintenance, and landscaping add to the quality of life for residents.

Now, the city of Saints is not only popular for its six historic gates but also has many developed and developing gated communities to provide a secure lifestyle.
