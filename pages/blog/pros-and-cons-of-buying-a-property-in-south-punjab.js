                                    Some regions of South Punjab, like Multan and Bahawalpur, are developing quickly, but the infrastructure of other regions still lags. Access to electricity, water, and public transit is restricted in isolated areas. This restriction could affect the property&apos;s resale value and create challenges for individuals looking to build homes in undeveloped regions. Before buying property in South Punjab, potential buyers must thoroughly research the region&apos;s infrastructure and development blueprints.
